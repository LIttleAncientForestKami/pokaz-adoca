== All in one: PlantUml

Way too much in one place, to the point PlantUML is installed as a separate Ruby Gem: `asciidoctor-diagram-plantuml`.
Install and usage: https://docs.asciidoctor.org/diagram-extension/latest/diagram_types/plantuml/

Tool page: https://plantuml.com/

.It supports UML of course. Credits: tool page screenshots
